          Did you ever imagine that how these graphics and games are run on a web-browser? What is the main technology behind it?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg px-32 mt-12">In previous days we used WebGL for this task. WebGL(Web graphics
          Library) is JavaScript API which is used to render the 3-dimensional
          objects, 2-dimensional objects and Graphics on the Web-Browser</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold px-64">Why 3JS when we have WebGL</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mt-12 px-32">WebGL is very low level system that only draws basic objects like point, square and line. To do any meaningful thing with WebGL generally requires quite a bit of code and that is where Three.js comes in. </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold px-64">What is Three.js?</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mt-12 px-32">Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. Three.js uses WebGL.</p>
                <p class="text-lg mt-12 px-32">Three.js was released by Ricardo Cabello in April 2010.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold px-64">Why Three.js?</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mt-12 px-32">Three.js makes WebGL - 3D in the browser - very easy. While a simple cube in raw WebGL would take hundreds of lines of code, a Three.js equivalent is just a few lines.</p>
        <p class="text-lg mt-12 px-32">Since we are using JavaScript, we can also interact with other HTML elements easily</p>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold px-64">Advantages of Three.js</h2>
          <p class="text-lg mt-12 px-32">Since Three.js is open source, we can easily watch the source code and understand the functionality of the code (functions).</p>
          <p class="text-lg mt-12 px-32">When we use WebGL for graphics, it doesn't support most browsers, but Three.js supports most browsers.</p>
          <p class="text-lg mt-12 px-32">It doesn't require any third-party plugin to run the code.</p>
          <p class="text-lg mt-12 px-32">You just need to work with JavaScript and HTML.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold px-64">How To Include Three.js in Your Projects?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg px-32 mt-4">Download the Three.js library from the official website.</p>
            <p class="text-lg px-32 mt-4">Use a CDN to include the Three.js library in your HTML file.</p>
            <p class="text-lg px-32 mt-4">Use Node.js to install Three.js as a dependency in your project.</p>

              <p class="text-xl mt-12 px-32">In a 3D scene, there are several key components:</p>
              <p class="text-lg px-32">
                Scene: Contains all the objects, lights, and cameras in the scene.
              </p>
              <p class="text-lg px-32">
                Camera: Determines the perspective and view of the scene.
              </p>
              <p class="text-lg px-32">
                Object: Represents the 3D objects in the scene, combining 
                <br/> and material to define their appearance and properties.
              </p>
              <p class="text-lg px-32">
                Lighting: Light up the scene.
              </p>
              <p class="text-lg px-32">
                Renderer: Renders the scene onto the canvas.
              </p>
